# Thin Film Deposition Robot with SILAR / Layer-by-Layer Method


## Overview
This project involves the construction of a robot designed for depositing thin films onto substrates using the Sequential Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) or Layer-by-Layer method. The robot is equipped with an ESP32 microcontroller, logic level converters, a DS3231 real-time clock sensor, encoders for precise control, and an I2C-connected LCD screen for user interface and feedback.

## Features
- Precise thin film deposition using SILAR or Layer-by-Layer method.
- Real-time clock (DS3231) for accurate timing and scheduling of deposition processes.
- User-friendly interface through an I2C-connected LCD screen.
- Encoder-based control for precise positioning and automation.
- Robust and expandable design for various applications in materials science and research.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 microcontroller.
- Logic level converters for interfacing with various sensors and devices.
- DS3231 real-time clock module.
- Rotary encoders for position control.
- I2C-connected LCD screen for user interaction.
- Additional components as needed for the deposition process (e.g., chemical delivery system, substrate holder).

## Software Requirements
The robot's software can be developed using the Arduino IDE with the ESP32 support. Additionally, any software related to the SILAR or Layer-by-Layer method should be installed and configured.

## Setup and Configuration
1. Assemble the robot components according to the provided schematics and design.
2. Connect the ESP32, logic level converters, DS3231, encoders, and the I2C LCD screen as per the wiring diagram.
3. Install the required libraries for the ESP32, DS3231, and I2C LCD in your Arduino IDE.
4. Develop the control software for the robot, incorporating the necessary logic for the deposition method.
5. Calibrate and test the robot's movements and deposition process.
6. Configure the DS3231 for accurate timekeeping and scheduling of deposition processes.

## Usage
1. Power on the robot.
2. Use the LCD screen to select the deposition parameters and process.
3. Start the deposition process, and the robot will follow the programmed instructions.
4. Monitor the progress on the LCD screen and make adjustments as needed.
